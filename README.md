Todo app is build using vite & deployed on Netlify at  https://main--todo1531.netlify.app/ <br/>
vite build - builds the app in dist folder <br/>
npm start - starts the dev server with hot-reload <br/>

Other frameworks beside vanilla js

I could have used jQuery to detect the clicked button of modal <br/>
It could have made the code more short & readable but nothing beats the vanilla js when it comes to speed. <br/>

Another framwork I found intesting is backbone.js <br/>
